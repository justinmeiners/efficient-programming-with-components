<h1>17. Adaptive merge sort</h1>

<a name="L-22-temporary-22--buffers-in-STL"></a>
<h2>&ldquo;temporary&rdquo; buffers in STL</h2>

<p>When I was implementing STL
I said that the OS vendor should know how much extra storage is available.
So, I&rsquo;m going to have this function called <code>get_temporary_buffer</code>
which allocates as much physical memory is available at this moment.
It&rsquo;s the only outside hook which STL will use.
But, it is vendor specific, you cannot do it as a client.
There is actually no call in UNIX which tells you how much physical memory
you have, how much is used, it&rsquo;s just impossible.
But, I needed to ship it, and in order to do that, I couldn&rsquo;t just require them to add a hook.
So I wrote the following thing:</p>

<pre><code>// ask for n, system gives you as much as it can, but not more than n.
std::pair&lt;void*, size_t&gt; get_temporary_buffer(size_t n) { 
  // this is bogus code and needs to be replaced
  void* buffer = malloc(n);
  while (!buffer &amp;&amp; n) {
    n = n &gt;&gt; 1;
    buffer = malloc(n);
  }
  return std::make_pair(buffer, n);
}
</code></pre>

<p>So it binary searches for a buffer small enough to fit<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
Is it a useful piece of code? No.
But, I had to ship.
Guess what happened after that.
You might think they didn&rsquo;t change it.
You&rsquo;re wrong, they did change it.
They removed my comment.</p>

<p>Every implementation, UNIX, Microsoft, Apple,
does the same binary search.
I have been telling this story for decades, nothing.
Therefore, my function always returns whatever you ask, because
it just allocates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.
It used to be a problem when we had 16-bit address spaces.
But, we have 64 bit address spaces.</p>

<p>If it was correct, I think it would be useful.
You want as much physical memory as the system has.
There is virtual memory but virtual memory is actually useless unless it&rsquo;s backed by physical memory.
It&rsquo;s useful for remapping things<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.
But, it is a figment of imagination.
It does not exist.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Cray">Seymour Cray</a> used to say, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t simulate what you do not have&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.
If your algorithm working set doesn&rsquo;t fit into physical memory,
it will not just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)">thrash</a>, your program will not terminate,
because your memory starts working at the speed of a disk.
That&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>

<p>It just shows you how imperfect life is.</p>

<a name="Merge-with-buffer"></a>
<h2>Merge with buffer</h2>

<p>The first thing we are going
to write is <code>merge_with_buffer</code>.
Let&rsquo;s assume that this buffer is big enough.
Eventually we will have to figure out how to deal with limited buffers.
Right, now let&rsquo;s assume whoever is going to call is going to assure it.
What we do is copy from the first range into our buffer,
then we merge back into the original buffer.</p>

<p>For now we can rely on <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/merge"><code>std::merge</code></a>,
but later we will write a better one.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename I, typename R, typename B&gt;
// requires I is ForwardIterator
// requires R is StrictWeakOrdering
// requires B is ForwardIterator
void merge_with_buffer(I first, I middle, I last, R r, B buffer) {
    B buffer_last = std::copy(first, middle, buffer);
    std::merge(buffer, buffer_last, middle, last, first, r);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even though we aren&rsquo;t worried about it now, we can see the buffer
will need to be big enough to copy the entire left half in,
so about size <code>n/2</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the buffer doesn&rsquo;t have to match the type of the container.
We will probably use an array for buffer,
but <code>I</code> could be an iterator for a linked list.
This is a general principle, relax type requirements.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s grab our in-place sort from before and modify it.
It&rsquo;s identical to our other,
except it uses our new <code>merge_with_buffer</code>.
Should this function allocate the buffer?
No because it is recursive.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename I, typename N, typename R, typename B&gt;
// I is ForwardIterator
// N is Integral
// R is WeakStrictOrdering on the value type of I 
I sort_inplace_n_with_buffer(I first, N n, R r, B buffer) {
  if (!n) return first;
  N half = n &gt;&gt; 1;
  if (!half) return ++first;
  I middle = sort_inplace_n_with_buffer(first, half, r, buffer);
  I last   = sort_inplace_n_with_buffer(middle, n - half, r, buffer);
  merge_with_buffer(first, middle, last, r, buffer);
  return last;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note we put the buffer argument at the end, because
we are extending the interface of the previous sort.</p>

<p>Now to use it in our framework we need a more convienent interface.
We have too many parameters, so we need to somehow get rid of all of them.
We write a wrapper.</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename I&gt;
// I is ForwardIterator
inline
void sort_inplace_with_buffer(I first, I last) {
    typedef typename std::iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::value_type T;
    typedef typename std::iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::difference_type N;
    N n = std::distance(first, last);
    std::vector&lt;T&gt; buffer(n &gt;&gt; 1);
    sort_inplace_n_with_buffer(first, n, std::less&lt;T&gt;(), buffer.begin());
}
</code></pre>

<p>We play the copy and paste game with our work from before.
The function <code>merge_inplace_left_subproblem</code>

<p>Now we know the drill to turn this into sort.
I will just show the sort so we can see the buffer allocation:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename I&gt;
// I is ForwardIterator
inline
void sort_1_8(I first, I last) {
  typedef typename std::iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::value_type T;
  typedef typename std::iterator_traits&lt;I&gt;::difference_type N;
  N n = std::distance(first, last);
  std::vector&lt;T&gt; buffer(n &gt;&gt; 3);
  sort_adaptive_n(first, n, std::less&lt;T&gt;(), buffer.begin(), N(buffer.size()));
}

<p>How does this one do?
Worse than before,
but we are also using about 10x less memory.</p>

<code>malloc</code> returns <code>NULL</code> when it fails to allocate of the requested size.
Alex&rsquo;s <code>get_temporary_buffer</code> function uses that as an indicator that the requested buffer was too large

<p>Virtual memory allows programs to allocate more memory than is physically available
by saving and loading portions of memory to disk as needed.
When memory is fully utilized the system starts working slower rather than simply crashing.</p>

<p>Even though the total amount of virtual memory available on a system is very large,
individual memory allocations are typically limited.
For example, when testing this code on Linux, the system only
allows a program to allocate a buffer up to the total physical memory size.</p>

<p>What this means is that Alex&rsquo;s implementation of <code>get_temporary_buffer</code> is not useful.
It is equivalent to <code>malloc(n)</code> for anything but extremely large allocations.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Experiment with <code>get_temporary_buffer</code> on your machine. How large of an allocation will it give you?</p><a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>Memory mapping files is a very useful application of virtual memory.
When a program wants to interact with a file on disk it can instead request that
the system map it to a range in memory.
The file can then be manipulated by reading and writing to pointers as if it was a buffer instead of a file.
In other words, the program can interact with the file, just like other data.
See <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> for details.</p>

<p>Alex has used memory mapped files in his own code.</p><a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></li>
